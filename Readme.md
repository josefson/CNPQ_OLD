# CNPQ
Captcha Negated by Python reQuests - For the CNPq lattes database.

The Lattes database was intended to be of public access, however it's managers 2 captchas in the way of getting an open data. With that problem in mind, this software was created to download the curriculums in a xml format one by one in an automated way.
The problem was broken into 3 parts, which are necessary for getting the final object: a xml file.
1- Through a blank search we get all the results existent. Then we will iterate over its pagination getting what i call of short_ids inside the hmtl attributes.
2- Once we have the short_ids, we will iterate over them requesting the curriculum visualization. This will result in a captcha page, which the software will solve, get the visualzation page and scrap the long_id out of its html attributes.
3- Only with a long_id we can get the downlaod links for each curriculum. Here a new captcha will be presented and the software will take care of it to.
